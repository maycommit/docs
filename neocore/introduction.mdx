# Neocore Documentation

Welcome to the **Neocore** documentation! Neocore is a cutting-edge platform focused on orchestrating node resources, particularly GPUs, to efficiently run actions, workflows, and devspaces. This documentation will guide you through the platform's features, functionality, and integration with our SaaS platform.

---

## What is Neocore?

Neocore is a resource orchestration platform designed to streamline the utilization of cluster resources, with a primary focus on GPUs. It enables users to manage clusters, run computational actions, orchestrate workflows, and create tailored environments (devspaces) for specific tasks. With a CLI interface and SaaS integration, Neocore provides a powerful yet flexible solution for resource-intensive operations.

### **SaaS Integration**
Neocore connects seamlessly with our SaaS platform to unlock additional capabilities. After initiating the connection via CLI, users must log in to the SaaS platform through the CLI to access features like advanced orchestration, centralized management, and analytics.

## Key Features

### 1. **Node Resource Orchestration**
At its core, Neocore focuses on efficiently orchestrating resources across nodes, including:
- **GPU Management**: Allocate GPUs dynamically to optimize task execution.
- **Resource Sharing**: Enable multiple workflows to leverage available resources without conflicts.
- **Monitoring and Logs**: Access detailed metrics and logs for resource usage on all nodes.

### 2. **Cluster Management**
Neocore provides robust tools for managing IA clusters, ensuring seamless operation. Key functionalities include:
- **Reconcile**: Automatically ensure clusters maintain their desired state.
- **Destroy**: Safely tear down clusters when they're no longer needed.
- **Stop**: Temporarily pause clusters while preserving their configurations.
- **Node Logs**: Access and analyze logs to monitor resource and node activity.

### 3. **Action: Modular Building Blocks**
Actions are self-contained tasks designed to harness node resources, especially GPUs. Features include:
- A marketplace of predefined actions, similar to GitHub Actions.
- Customization options to adapt actions to specific workloads.
- Resource-aware execution, optimizing GPU and other node usage.

### 4. **Workflow Orchestration**
Neocore workflows enable seamless orchestration of multiple actions, offering:
- Support for parallel or sequential execution.
- Intuitive CLI-based definitions for complex workflows.
- Efficient scheduling to maximize GPU utilization.

### 5. **Devspace Environments**
A **Devspace** is a user-specific environment created on a node, designed for development or testing. Features include:
- On-demand provisioning of resources, including GPUs.
- Isolation from other workloads for focused tasks.
- Integration with cluster and SaaS tools for enhanced productivity.

### 6. **Model Inference Management**
Neocore simplifies deploying and managing inference servers for machine learning models. Supported inference frameworks include:
- **Hugging Face Models**: Deploy pre-trained models directly from Hugging Face.
- **Neolang**: Use our proprietary model inference system for high-performance deployments.

Capabilities include:
- Deploying, starting, and stopping inference servers.
- Monitoring model performance and resource utilization.

## SaaS Connection Workflow

Neocore's integration with our SaaS platform adds significant value to resource orchestration. The workflow includes:

1. **Initiate SaaS Connection**: Use the CLI to start the connection process.
2. **Login**: Authenticate with the SaaS platform via CLI to unlock full functionality.
3. **Leverage SaaS Features**:
   - Centralized resource and workflow management.
   - Advanced analytics for GPU and node utilization.
   - Enhanced orchestration across distributed clusters.

## How Neocore Works

Neocore operates as an operator running on every node within your cluster. This decentralized architecture ensures high availability and efficient resource utilization across all nodes.

### **CLI-Driven Management**
The CLI provides comprehensive control over Neocore, allowing users to:
- Manage node resources, clusters, workflows, and devspaces.
- Allocate GPUs dynamically to actions and workflows.
- Monitor resource usage and logs in real time.
- Connect to the SaaS platform for extended capabilities.
